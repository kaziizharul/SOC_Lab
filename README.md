# DDL Injection Attack Detection and Investigation Using Wazuh SIEM

A hands-on detection-engineering lab demonstrating how to detect, alert on,
and investigate a **DDL Injection attack** (`DROP` / `ALTER` / `CREATE` /
`TRUNCATE` statements smuggled through an unsanitized SQL Injection point)
using **Wazuh SIEM**, **DVWA**, and **MySQL general query log** as the
evidence source.

> DDL injection is a more destructive sibling of classic SQL injection —
> instead of just reading data (`SELECT`), the attacker rewrites the
> database schema itself (drops tables, alters columns, creates rogue
> tables for persistence). This project shows the full attack-to-alert
> pipeline: exploit → log → decode → rule match → alert → investigate.

## Lab Topology

| Role | Hostname | IP Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Attacker / Wazuh Manager | `kali` | `192.168.121.128` | Kali Linux — runs the SQLi/DDLi payloads and hosts the Wazuh manager + dashboard |
| Target / Wazuh Agent | `windows` (agent **001**) | `192.168.121.129` | Wazuh agent `v4.13.1`, monitored endpoint running the vulnerable web app stack |

This mirrors the agent registration shown in the Wazuh **Endpoints summary**
view below (agent `001`, status `active`, registered against manager node
`node01`).

## Detection Logic

| Component | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Decoder | [local_decoder.xml](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/29137858/local_decoder.xml) | Parses MySQL general query log lines into `data.query`, `data.user`, `data.srcip` |
| Rule | [local_rules.xml](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/29142272/local_rules.xml) | Rule `100002` (level 12) fires when `data.query` matches `^(DROP\|ALTER\|CREATE\|TRUNCATE)\s+TABLE` |
| Log source | [ossec_localfile_snippet.xml](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/29142385/ossec_localfile_snippet.xml) | Ships `/var/log/mysql/mysql.log` from the agent to the manager |

Rule `100002` maps to **MITRE ATT&CK T1190 — Exploit Public-Facing
Application**, and is tagged for **PCI DSS 6.5.1** (injection flaws).

## Attack Simulation

The full attack chain — confirm injection point → `DROP TABLE` →
`ALTER TABLE` → `CREATE TABLE` (backdoor) — is scripted in
[simulate_ddl_injection.sh](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/29137511/simulate_ddl_injection.sh)

for repeatable testing against a DVWA instance set to **security level: low**.

```bash
./scripts/simulate_ddl_injection.sh 192.168.121.129 "PHPSESSID=...; security=low" "<csrf_token>"
```

⚠️ Lab Environment Only
This project was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment for educational and defensive security research purposes. All testing was performed on intentionally vulnerable systems owned and managed by the author. Do not deploy these configurations in production environments or expose them to public networks.

## Walkthrough

### 1 — Dashboard overview
Wazuh **Security events → Dashboard** showing the spike in alert volume
during the attack window: total events, level-12+ alerts, and the
top-talking agents.

### 2 — Payload delivery (DVWA)
The injection payload submitted through DVWA's SQL Injection page. The
`User ID` field carries a stacked query (`1'; DROP TABLE users; --`) instead
of a single ID.

### 3 — Alert detail
Wazuh's expanded alert view for rule `100002` — **"DDL Injection Attempt
Detected"** at severity **High** (level 12), with source IP, user, and the
exact query that triggered the rule.

### 4 — Log analysis
The raw evidence on the target host: `mysql.log` (general query log)
showing the `SELECT` baseline followed by the `DROP TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`,
and `CREATE TABLE` statements as they actually executed.

### 5 — Investigation (expanded document)
The fully parsed Wazuh event document — `agent.id`, `data.srcip`,
`data.user`, `rule.id`, `rule.level`, and `full_log` — used to confirm
attribution and timeline during incident investigation.

### Combined view

## Sample Artifacts

- [sample_mysql_general.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/29137297/sample_mysql_general.log) — raw log lines that produced the alert
- [sample_alert.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/29137359/sample_alert.json) — the parsed Wazuh alert document

---

## Reproducing This Lab

1. Stand up Wazuh manager + indexer + dashboard (Kali host, `192.168.121.128`, or any manager host).
2. Install the Wazuh agent on the target web server and register it (agent `001`, `192.168.121.129`).
3. Deploy DVWA on the target, backed by MySQL/MariaDB.
4. Enable MySQL's general query log:
   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
   SET GLOBAL general_log_file = '/var/log/mysql/mysql.log';
   ```
5. Copy `wazuh-config/local_decoder.xml` → `/var/ossec/etc/decoders/` on the manager.
6. Copy `wazuh-config/local_rules.xml` → `/var/ossec/etc/rules/` on the manager.
7. Add the `<localfile>` block from `wazuh-config/ossec_localfile_snippet.xml` to the agent's `ossec.conf`.
8. Restart the manager (`systemctl restart wazuh-manager`) and the agent.
9. Run `scripts/simulate_ddl_injection.sh` against the target and watch the alert land in **Security events**.

## Key Takeaways

- **DDL statements in application logs are a strong, low-noise signal.**
  Legitimate web apps almost never issue `DROP`/`ALTER`/`CREATE` through
  user-facing input — a single match is high-confidence.
- **Decoder + rule pairing turns an unstructured log into a queryable
  field** (`data.query`), which is what makes the regex-based detection
  reliable instead of a blind substring grep.
- **The investigation view (raw → parsed → alert) closes the loop**
  between "something fired" and "here is exactly what happened, from
  where, as whom."
